      <h2>Our History</h2>
   
       <br>
      <center><img src="cpeb.jpg" width="450" > </center> <br>
   
      <p>In 1992, a group of computer engineers formed the Philippine Institute of Computer Engineers, Inc. (PhICEs).  PhICEs managed to gather a number of professional members.  They conducted conventions, seminars and symposia in several regions in Luzon and Visayas.  After being active for several years, PhICEs became inactive. <br><br>

In 2008, computer engineers from different organizations converged to revive the professional organization.  The group, headed by Engr. Erwin G. Mendoza and Engr. Alexander B. Ybasco, continued what the PhICEs started.  After several meetings, the group decided to change its name.  Thus, the Institute of Computer Engineers of the Philippines, Inc. (ICpEP) was born. <br><br>

ICpEP continues to establish a strong partnership with the industry.  Well-known companies such as Intel, Microsoft, HP, Lenovo, Epson, Red Fox, and PC Buyers Guide recognize ICpEP as the sole organization dedicated to computer engineers in the Philippines.  Furthermore, ICpEP has made collaboration with SM Mall of Asia, in the presence of NIDO Fortified Science Discovery Center, to promote research and development in the Philippines through a showcase of notable design projects in field of computer engineering.<br><br>

ICpEP has successfully formed its academic linkage to universities and colleges through the ICpEP Student Edition (ICpEP.SE).  Created in 2008, ICpEP.SE started with 11 schools, namely: Adamson University, Asia Pacific College, Central Colleges of the Philippines, De La Salle University, Far Eastern University-East Asia College, Mapua Institute of Technology, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, Polytechnic University of the Philippines-Manila, STI College-Recto, and Technological Institute of the Philippines-Manila and Technological Institute of the Philippines -Quezon City.  Now, ICpEP.SE is composed of more than sixty-eight (68) schools from all over the Philippines.
<br><br>
ICpEP firmly believes that uniting our professionals will contribute to national development and will improve the lives of the people.  With the support of industry and academe, ICpEP will remain as a recognized professional organization of computer engineers.  ICpEP strives to engage every Filipino computer engineer to become active, involved and significant in achieving one common goal: to become world-class</p>
